# Community Garden Smart Contract

## Vision

The Community Garden project aims to promote shared gardening spaces within communities by creating a decentralized platform for renting garden plots. By using blockchain technology, this project provides a transparent and secure solution for managing the rental of garden plots, encouraging community participation in urban gardening initiatives.

## Features

- **Create Garden Plot**: Garden plot owners can list their plots for rent, specifying a unique identifier.
- **Rent Garden Plot**: Users can rent available garden plots, enabling community members to grow their own plants and contribute to urban sustainability.
- **Real-Time Availability Tracking**: Availability status of garden plots is recorded on-chain, ensuring transparency for both plot owners and renters.

## Contract Address

- **Network**: Aptos Devnet
- **Contract Address**: `0x046c93e6320fe9d01de6f0fbb986e286e12a109d6f848e99ec61a5570db044c2`

## How It Works

1. **Create Garden Plot**:

   - Garden plot owners call the `create_garden_plot` function to create and list a garden plot for rent.
   - The plot is represented by `GardenPlot` and includes the owner's address and a unique identifier (`plot_id`).

2. **Rent Garden Plot**:
   - Renters call the `rent_garden_plot` function to rent an available garden plot.
   - The contract checks if the plot is available and updates its status to indicate it is rented.
   - Payment handling is assumed to be managed off-chain in this implementation.

## Future Scope

- **Payment Integration**: Implement on-chain payment handling to securely process rental payments between renters and plot owners.
- **Rental Duration**: Introduce rental duration support, allowing plot owners to specify the rental period, after which the plot becomes available again.
- **Booking System**: Create a booking feature that allows users to reserve garden plots for future dates.
- **Rating and Review**: Add functionality for renters to rate their experience with the garden plot, providing feedback to owners and other community members.
- **Community Events**: Allow community members to organize events related to urban gardening and shared garden maintenance.
- **Security Deposit**: Introduce a security deposit system to ensure that plots are returned in good condition after the rental period.

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies for the Aptos blockchain.
- Deploy the contract using your preferred deployment tool.
- Once deployed, garden plot owners can list plots for rent, and community members can rent available plots through the smart contract functions.
